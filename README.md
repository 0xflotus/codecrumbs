## [ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. STAY TUNED!]

# codecrumbs
Leave "breadcrumbs" in source code via comments to find your way out from code maze

## In a big codebase we can’t:
- generalize
- recognise patterns
- see big picture
- make assumption 

## This project will allow you to: 
- leave bread crumbs in a code maze
- cut off paths leading nowhere
- see entire maze from a “bird’s-eye” view
